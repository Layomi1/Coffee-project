        It has been said to taste best when it has been brewed through a Chemex machine. This machine will bring out the
        smooth
        texture and purer flavor of the blend. A Chemex is a “slow-and-steady” approach to coffee brewing, similar to a drip
        machine, but with a filter that is 3 times as thick. The machine keeps the water that is pouring over the beans at
        an
        ideal 190 degrees, draws out any excess oil residue on the bean, and provides the smoothest and purest taste of
        these
        unique blends.
